# Deployment and CI/CD Documentation for WordPress Project for WIS DevOps Test

## Introduction

This document outlines the deployment process for a WordPress project using a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, including backup automation, health checks, and server configuration best practices. The project utilizes AWS resources and ensures efficient deployment and management of the WordPress application.

## 1. Project Setup

### EC2 Instance

- **Instance Creation**: An EC2 instance was created using AWS CDK (Python) to host the WordPress application.
- **Security Groups**: Ports 80 (HTTP) and 22 (SSH) were configured to allow web traffic and remote access.

### S3 Bucket

- **Purpose**: An S3 bucket was set up to store backups of the MySQL database.
- **Configuration**: The bucket was configured to be accessible by the WordPress application for backup purposes.

### WordPress Installation

- **Method**: WordPress was installed on the EC2 instance using a user data script. This installation includes the default WordPress setup, which ensures that the application is ready for further customization.

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

### Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is managed using GitHub Actions. This automation tool helps streamline the deployment process by triggering actions on code changes in master branch.

### Key Steps

- **Build Theme Assets**: The pipeline compiles the theme assets (SCSS and JS files). This step ensures that any changes to the theme are properly built before deployment.
- **Deploy to Server**: The updated files are transferred to the EC2 instance. This is accomplished using `rsync`, which synchronizes the local files with the server.
- **Check Response Code**: After deployment, a health check is performed to verify that the WordPress site is accessible and returns a status code of 200. This step ensures that the site is live and operational after updates.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

A GitHub Actions workflow is set up to automate the build, deployment, and testing processes. It includes:

- **Checkout Code**: Retrieves the latest code from the repository.
- **Build Theme Assets**: Compiles SCSS and JS files for the WordPress theme.
- **Deploy to Server**: Uses `rsync` to deploy the updated files to the EC2 instance.
- **Check WordPress Site Response Code**: Performs a health check to ensure the site is responding with a status code of 200.

## 3. Backup Automation

### Backup Process

The backup process involves regularly saving copies of the MySQL database to the S3 bucket. This ensures that data can be recovered in case of any issues or data loss. Backups are automated using a cron job on the EC2 instance, which runs every sunday at midnight.

If one wants to backup the db locally, one can use:
bash
```
mysqldump --no-tablespaces -h 52.31.56.237 -u wordpressuser -pwordpresspassword wordpress > backup_file.sql
```

This command connects to the MySQL server at 52.31.56.237, uses the wordpressuser account, and dumps the wordpress database to a file named backup_file.sql.

### Benefits

- **Data Safety**: Regular backups protect against data loss.
- **Automated Management**: Automation reduces manual intervention and ensures consistent backup schedules.

## 4. Documentation and Improvement Summary

### GitHub Repository

- **Repository**: https://github.com/Dwayne-Zammit/wordpress-deployment-aws

### Decisions and Challenges

- **CI/CD Setup**: Integrated automated deployments to ensure that updates are deployed smoothly and efficiently upon merge to master using git actions.
- **Backup Automation**: Set up cron job to backup db to an S3 bucket to safeguard data.
- **Health Checks**: Implemented response code checks to confirm the operational status of the WordPress site after deployment.

### Improvements

- **Automation**: The automation of deployment and backups enhances operational efficiency and reduces manual errors.
- **Testing**: Health checks provide assurance that the WordPress site is functioning correctly after updates.
- **Server Configuration**: NGINX/SSL configuration should be performed to increase security.
## Conclusion

This setup provides a robust solution for deploying and managing a WordPress application. By leveraging CI/CD pipelines, automated backups, the deployment process is streamlined, reliable, and efficient.
