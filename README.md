# WordPress Deployment on AWS EC2 using Python CDK

This repository provides a setup for deploying a WordPress application on an AWS EC2 server using Python CDK. The deployment includes installing WordPress and MySQL via a user-data script during the first deployment. Additionally, the deployment is managed via GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS CLI**: Ensure that you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials.
- **Python 3.x**: Required for Python CDK.
- **AWS CDK**: Ensure that you have the AWS CDK installed.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipeline management.

## Deployment

### Provision Infrastructure with CDK

Ensure you have Python and AWS CDK installed. Then, use the following commands to deploy the infrastructure:

```bash
cdk bootstrap
cdk deploy

This will create the necessary AWS resources, including an EC2 instance for running WordPress.
User Data Script

The user-data script is executed upon the first launch of the EC2 instance. It installs WordPress and MySQL, and configures the application.
Deploying via GitHub Actions

The deployment process is automated using GitHub Actions. Ensure your GitHub Actions workflows are set up correctly to handle deployment tasks.
Bootstrapping WordPress

After deployment, you may need to bootstrap the WordPress application using additional steps defined in your GitHub Actions workflows.
Backing Up MySQL Database Locally

To back up the MySQL database locally, follow these steps:
Ensure MySQL Client is Installed

Make sure you have the MySQL client installed on your local machine. You can install it using the package manager appropriate for your operating system.
Run mysqldump Command

Use the following command to create a backup of the WordPress MySQL database:

bash```


```bash
mysqldump --no-tablespaces -h [EC2_PUBLIC_IP] -u [DB_USER] -p[DB_PASSWORD] [DB_NAME] > [BACKUP_FILE].sql
bash```

Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values:

    [EC2_PUBLIC_IP]: The public IP address of your EC2 instance (e.g., 52.31.56.237).
    [DB_USER]: Your MySQL username (e.g., wordpressuser).
    [DB_PASSWORD]: Your MySQL password (e.g., wordpresspassword).
    [DB_NAME]: The name of the database you want to back up (e.g., wordpress).
    [BACKUP_FILE]: The name of the file to which the backup will be saved (e.g., backup_file).

Example:

```bash
mysqldump --no-tablespaces -h 52.31.56.237 -u wordpressuser -pwordpresspassword wordpress > backup_file.sql
bash```

This command will create a file named backup_file.sql containing the SQL dump of your WordPress database.
